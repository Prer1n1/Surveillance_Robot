**Flask Integration -**

To facilitate seamless monitoring and control, the Raspberry Pi is configured to function as a web server. This setup enables operators to access and manage the robot's activities through a user-friendly ebpage interface. By connecting to the web server, users can receive real-time updates, view live data feeds, and make informed decisions based on the comprehensive information gathered by the robot. 
 
The primary objective of deploying this robotic system is to achieve a holistic understanding of the target area. This understanding is crucial for making well-informed decisions and implementing necessary interventions, whether for scientific research, safety assessments, or operational planning. Through the continuous real-time data provided by the robot, operators can effectively monitor and respond to the dynamic conditions of the environment, ensuring optimal outcomes for the mission at hand.

This project utilizes TCP and HTTP protocols to establish seamless communication between the Raspberry Pi and external systems, enabling remote access, control, and web-based interactions.

**TCP Protocol for Remote Access**
To establish a reliable connection between the Raspberry Pi and a local machine, the RealVNC API is employed. This allows for remote access to the Raspberry Piâ€™s GUI, enabling users to execute commands, run applications, and perform maintenance tasks efficiently.

**HTTP Protocol for Web-Based Interaction**
The Flask framework is used to host a webpage, leveraging the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for communication. Flask simplifies request handling using decorators like @app.route, mapping URLs to specific functions for seamless web interactions.
